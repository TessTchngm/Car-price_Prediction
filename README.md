# Car-price_Prediction 
##### The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can indicate which car features are related to fluctuations in Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and in which direction. By understanding the relationship between car characteristics and MSRP, this model will enable manufacturers to set reasonable and competitive prices for their vehicles.

##### Accurately predicting MSRP is crucial for both sellers and buyers in the automotive industry. For sellers, such as car dealers or manufacturers, this model will provide valuable insights into pricing strategies. It will help optimize pricing decisions by identifying the car features that contribute to higher or lower MSRP. By setting appropriate prices based on these insights, sellers can maximize profits and minimize the risk of overpricing or underpricing their vehicles. For example, a car dealer can adjust the price based on the MSRP prediction to gain a higher commission, while a car manufacturer can determine the features that justify a higher MSRP.

##### From a buyer's perspective, this model will provide potential car buyers with valuable information to consider before making a purchase decision. By understanding which features impact the MSRP and in which direction, buyers can evaluate the reasonableness of the listed price and negotiate more effectively. This empowers buyers to make informed choices and potentially save money when purchasing a car.

# Overall, this project aims to benefit both sellers and buyers in the automotive industry by providing insights into the relationship between car features and MSRP. By leveraging the predictive power of the developed model, sellers can optimize pricing strategies and maximize profits, while buyers can make informed decisions and potentially negotiate better deals.
